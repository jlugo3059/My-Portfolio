# [Project 1: Multivariable Regression (Accapted Loans)] (https://github.com/jlugo3059/Multivariable-Regression) 

This project focuses on doing a multivariable regression on an loans dataset. The loans dataset comprises data from over one million borrowers who were approved to receive loans by the Lending Club company. Using the provided data, the model developed in this project will employ a multivariable regression technique to predict interest rates by considering independent variables given in the dataset.

* The data was taken from kaggle and modified in order to reduce computational strain on jupyter notebook.
* The data cleaning phase of the project removes all null values from the project and creates dummy variables for categorical variables.
* The featured scaling technique used in this project is normalization 
* The regression method used is Least Squares
